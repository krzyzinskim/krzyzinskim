## Hi there! 👋

- 👨🏻‍💻 I'm a member of [MI².AI](https://www.mi2.ai), where I'm working on explainable artificial intelligence and applications of machine learning in healthcare.

- 👀 I'm interested in responsible machine learning but also in data visualization, statistics, functional data analysis, and climate science.

- 📂 Some of my projects: 
  - [SurvSHAP(t)](https://github.com/MI2DataLab/survshap) - the method developed for time-dependent explanations of survival models (with Python implementation)
  - [survex](https://github.com/ModelOriented/survex) - the R package providing model-agnostic explanations for survival models 
  - [Aspect](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEX/tree/master/python/dalex/dalex/aspect) - the module of the [dalex](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEX) Python package for global and local explanations that take into account the dependencies between the variables
  - [artemis](https://github.com/pyartemis/artemis) - the Python package with explanation methods for extraction of feature interactions from predictive models
