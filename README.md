## Hi there! 👋

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about me, please visit [my personal website](https://krzyzinski.com).

- 👨🏻‍💻 Currently, I'm a ML Security Engineer at Snowflake (and use another GitHub account in work).

- 👀 I'm interested in AI security and safety. 

- Previously I was a member of [MI².AI](https://www.mi2.ai) research lab, where I was working on explainable and interpretable artificial intelligence and applications of machine learning in healthcare. Here are some of my academic projects that you can find on GitHub: 
  - [SurvSHAP(t)](https://github.com/MI2DataLab/survshap) - the method developed for time-dependent explanations of survival models (with Python implementation)
  - [survex](https://github.com/ModelOriented/survex) - the R package providing model-agnostic explanations for survival models 
  - [Aspect](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEX/tree/master/python/dalex/dalex/aspect) - the module of the [dalex](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEX) Python package for global and local explanations that take into account the dependencies between the variables
  - [artemis](https://github.com/pyartemis/artemis) - the Python package with explanation methods for extraction of feature interactions from predictive models
  - [treeshap](https://github.com/ModelOriented/treeshap) - the R package for fast computation of SHAP values using TreeSHAP algorithm (mantaining and improving)
